### Latest project I'm working at [MadeiraMadeira](madeiramadeira.com.br)

Basically, this project consists of 5 stages:

**1st** - Extract the data from Google Analytics (GA3 and GA4) and Google Merchant Center and then store it in tables in Google BigQuery.

**2nd** - Extract the data that was stored in Google BigQuery in step 1 then export it to AWS S3

**3rd** - Curate the data and transform it according to the business rules

**4th** - Run the AWS Redshift copy command to get the data from the curated files then make it available to consumers via dashboards and visualization tools
